# Tetris Clone (TypeScript + Phaser.js)

A classic Tetris clone built entirely in TypeScript using the Phaser.js game framework.

This repository serves as a hands-on learning resource, demonstrating key game-development concepts—asset loading, tile-based mechanics, real-time input handling, scoring systems, and scene management—within a modern TypeScript codebase.
